#     Golf Event Selector
### Video Demo:https://studio.youtube.com/video/IwrwWF-Pj8Q/edit
### Selection code for golf players
Using their Gender and Handicap from 'players.csv', which consists
of the player's name, gender and handicap to create a file named
'events.csv' with a list consisting of name, event and division
for the next golf event.
The names and details of the players can be entered into the 'players'
file using a text editor or create an entry code for that purpose.
When the command 'python project.py players.csv events.csv' at the
terminal command line in the correct directory, the 'events.csv'
file will hold the players name, event and division for the event.
I have narrated the video with text to speech to illustrate the
video in support of this readme file.
